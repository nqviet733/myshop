This set of Angular UI Boostrap files is from https://github.com/jbruni/bootstrap-bower-jbruni
Angular UI Bootstrap 0.11.0 doesn't have support for templates inside popovers,
This update from jbruni has implemented this.

For more information about whether Angular UI Bootstrap has implemented these features yet,
Please see that issue on their github - https://github.com/angular-ui/bootstrap/issues/220

If you are planning to update this library, please check to ensure that either:
    - templates inside popovers have been implemented in the new version
    - the jbruni fork has been updated to the latest version

The only place that the new popovers are being used in this project is on reports.html
